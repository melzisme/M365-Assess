## What is this?

M365 Assess runs a single read-only command against a Microsoft 365 tenant and produces CSV data, a self-contained branded HTML report, and an XLSX compliance matrix covering identity, email, security, devices, collaboration, and compliance baselines.

<!-- registry-stats:summary:begin -->
**292 automated security checks** mapped across **15 compliance frameworks** — counts generated from [`controls/registry.json`](src/M365-Assess/controls/registry.json); per-framework coverage in [docs/reference/COVERAGE.md](docs/reference/COVERAGE.md).
<!-- registry-stats:summary:end -->

It is built for security administrators, compliance officers, IT consultants / vCISOs, auditors, and CI pipelines - anyone who needs a fast, evidence-backed posture snapshot mapped to CIS, NIST, SOC 2, HIPAA, ISO 27001, and more.

## Install

```powershell
Install-Module M365-Assess -Scope CurrentUser
```

Graph and EXO dependencies are declared in the manifest and installed automatically. For install from source, the ZIP-unblock step, and full prerequisites, see the [Quickstart guide](docs/user/QUICKSTART.md).

## Run it

```powershell
Invoke-M365Assessment -TenantId 'contoso.onmicrosoft.com'
```

Results land in a timestamped folder with CSV data, an HTML report, and an XLSX compliance matrix. Run with no parameters to launch an interactive wizard that walks you through section selection, tenant, authentication, and output folder.

For section selection, the full parameter reference, connection profiles, cloud environments, and standalone collector usage, see the [Execution guide](docs/user/RUN.md). Running against GCC High? See the [GCC High setup guide](docs/user/GCC-HIGH-SETUP.md).

## Sections

Thirteen assessment sections cover Tenant, Identity, Licensing, Email, Intune, Security, Collaboration, Hybrid, and PowerBI by default, plus opt-in Inventory, ActiveDirectory, SOC2, and ValueOpportunity. The full collector catalogue and per-section detail live in the [Execution guide](docs/user/RUN.md#available-sections).

```powershell
# Run specific sections
Invoke-M365Assessment -Section Identity,Email -TenantId 'contoso.onmicrosoft.com'
```

## Report preview

The self-contained HTML report opens in any browser with no dependencies. Click through from the executive overview to individual security domains, drill into findings, and review compliance posture across 15 frameworks - all in a single offline file.

> **Handling sensitive output:** assessment files contain UPNs, mailbox metadata, admin role assignments, and policy bodies - treat them as confidential. See [`docs/reference/DATA-HANDLING.md`](docs/reference/DATA-HANDLING.md).
