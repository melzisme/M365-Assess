## Cross-link footer template

Every doc in this tree includes a "See also" footer linking to the most-relevant siblings. If you're adding a new doc, follow the same pattern. The template:

```markdown
---

## See also

- [`<sibling-1>`](path) — one-line description
- [`<sibling-2>`](path) — one-line description
- [`INDEX.md`](../INDEX.md) — back to the docs index
```

## Convention

- **Audience first** — pick `user/`, `dev/`, or `reference/` based on who reads the doc, not what it's about.
- **Cross-link, don't duplicate** — if a concept is documented in another file, link to it rather than restating.
- **No issue-number suffixes in titles** — implementation history lives in commit messages and PR descriptions, not file titles.
- **Subdir READMEs only when the subdir has multiple docs** — `research/` and `design/` may not need a README each unless they grow large.
