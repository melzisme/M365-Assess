# Issue #884: lock-down regression preventing silent growth in Review /
# Unknown / Skipped status emissions across collectors. The full audit
# catalogue + classification framework lives at
# docs/research/review-status-audit.md.
#
# When a contributor adds a new emission site, this test fails, forcing
# them to:
#   1. Justify the new emission in the PR description (genuine limitation
#      vs. collector bug?)
#   2. Add the new site to the audit catalogue in
#      docs/research/review-status-audit.md
#   3. Raise the ceiling in this test
#
# Without this guardrail, "I couldn't measure it, returning Review"
# silently accumulates and erodes the report's credibility.
#
# Ceiling values are the snapshot taken 2026-04-30. Adjust ONLY when
# the audit doc has been updated to reflect the new state.
